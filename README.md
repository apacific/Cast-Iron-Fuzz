# Cast-Iron Fuzz

An analog effects circuit for electric instruments, with gain staging and voicing suitable for lead guitar. Based on the classic Fuzz Face by Dallas Arbiter and the LPB-1 by Electro-Harmonix.

### Electronics and Wiring

The parts were from a variety of sources, but the transistors were new-old-stock silicon transistors found at electronics salvage retailers. Wired by hand on through-hole prototype board and housed in a Hammond enclosure.

### Enclosure and Graphics

A sheet of star stickers from the Dollar Tree was used as a mask to apply black enamel spray paint, which was then used as a mask to etch the aluminum enclosure with ferric chloride. Finished in rattle-can clearcoat in my basement.
